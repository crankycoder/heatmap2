This is a bootstrapped hybrid addon which is primarily a WebExtension, but also has a bootstrapped component to support
extra features that are not available in WebExtensions.

Although there is a bootstrapped component to this addon, it should primarily
be thought of as a WebExtension that is supported by the bootstrap code where
pre-existing browser APIs do not provide sufficient event generation
capability.
